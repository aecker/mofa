Setting up virtualenv
----------------

Set up the virtual environment:

::

    virtualenv venv --distribute

This makes a folder ``venv``.  

Construct requirements.txt (see example).

To jump into the virtual environment:

::

    . venv/bin/activate

For your first session in the environment, you'll need to install your dependencies:

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

To exit the environment:

::

    deactivate
